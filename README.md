## Topics Covered

1. **Cosmology Review Lecture**  
   Overview of the standard cosmological model (ŒõCDM), cosmic history, key observables, and fundamental assumptions.

2. **Boltzmann Solver and Basic Tools**  
   Introduction to Boltzmann solvers like CLASS or CAMB, computation of the matter power spectrum, and how to extract cosmological observables.

3. **N-point Statistics**  
   Study of two-point and higher-order correlation functions and power spectra, key tools to describe large-scale structure.

4. **Gaussian Random Fields: Initial Conditions and Evolution**  
   Simulation of initial conditions in the early universe, properties of Gaussian fields, and their evolution under gravity.

5. **Galaxy Clusters: Mass Function and Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD)**  
   Modeling the abundance of collapsed structures and how galaxies populate dark matter halos.

6. **Fitting Methods and Parameter Inference**  
   Parameter estimation using likelihoods, MCMC sampling, and practical fitting techniques for observational data.
