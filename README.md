## Topics Covered

1. **Statistical Inference in Cosmology**  
   Fundamentals of estimating cosmological parameters, Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches, priors and posteriors.

2. **Likelihood Methods & Fisher Matrix Forecasting**  
   Construction of likelihoods, œá¬≤ minimization, and Fisher matrix evaluations for survey predictions :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

3. **Sampling Techniques: MCMC & Nested Sampling**  
   Practical implementation of posterior sampling methods such as Metropolis‚ÄìHastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

4. **Covariance, Error Propagation & Model Selection**  
   Dealing with correlated data, propagating uncertainties, and comparing cosmological models on statistical grounds :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

5. **Numerical Methods for Cosmological Observables**  
   Programming simple numerical routines relevant for large-scale structure or background evolution.

Each notebook is designed to be self-contained and beginner-friendly, while introducing concepts directly applicable to cosmological data analysis.
