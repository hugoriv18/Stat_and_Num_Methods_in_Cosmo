# üìä Statistical and Numerical Methods in Cosmology

This repository contains exercises from the course *Statistical and Numerical Methods in Cosmology*. The focus is on basic programming techniques commonly used in observational cosmology, including data analysis, statistical modeling, and numerical computations.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `notebooks/` ‚Äì Jupyter notebooks covering practical examples and exercises  
- `data/` ‚Äì Supporting datasets used in the notebooks  
- `images/` ‚Äì Plots and visual assets for documentation or presentation

## Topics Covered

1. Statistical sampling and distributions
2. Bayesian parameter estimation
3. Likelihood functions and MCMC
4. Model fitting in cosmology
5. Error propagation and covariance
6. Basic visualization with `matplotlib`

Each notebook is designed to be self-contained and beginner-friendly, while introducing concepts directly applicable to cosmological data analysis.
